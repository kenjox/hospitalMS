/**
 * A "generic" report element that will produce a 
 * {@link JRGenericPrintElement generic print element} in the generated
 * report.
 * 
 * <p>
 * Such elements can be used in simple scenarios that involve generating
 * generic print elements.  In more complex scenarios,
 * {@link JRComponentElement component elements} that produce generic
 * print elements can be implemented.
 * 
 * <p>
 * Generic report elements are comprised of a list of parameters that are to
 * be included in the generated print element.
 * At fill time, expressions associated with the parameters are evaluated and
 * the result is preserved in the print element.
 * Generic report elements cannot stretch at fill time, they will always produce
 * a print element that has the same size as the design element.
